# UNIT CONVERTER by NaИ Λrk

Simple C Project

This is just my study about **C Programming Language**. It's been a while I don't coding since my laptop broke and I only struggle with my own phone. This project was made only using **Redmi Note 11** and **Termux**.

The purpose  of this project is to make a simple unit converter such as length, weight, time, and even data.

## How to Compile
Make sure Clang or GCC Installed.
>> clang *.c -Wall -Wextra -std=c99 -Ofast -g
